## What this repository is for?

This repository proposes comparison between algorithmic graph realizations in C++,Java and EO.

## How to use

### Tools to be installed

#### Java
First, you need to install Java Development Kit (JDK) on your machine in order to build and work with eo_graphs. Version 11 of JDK would be a good option (you can find 
installation packages [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)). 

#### C++
Second, you need to install GCC on your machine in order to build and work with eo_graphs. Version 11.1 is optimal(you can find 
installation packages [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-11/)).

#### Maven
Third, you need to install Maven on your machine in order to build and work with eo_graphs. Version 3.8.2 is needed(you can find 
installation packages [here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)).

### Downloading sources
Then, fork this repository with git:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:HSE-Eolang/eo_graphs.git
```

### Run scripts 
All scripts are running from the root folder of repository.

#### Ð¡ompilation of Java, EO and C ++ source codes

```bash
./scripts/compile.sh
```

#### Comparing the results of executing programs in different languages, to make sure that the result is identical.

```bash
./scripts/compare.sh
```

#### Testing of the execution time and memory consumption of programs on graphs of different sizes. 
Graphs are generated randomly by an [utility](https://github.com/HSE-Eolang/eo_graphs/blob/master/src/main/java/ru/hse/eo_graphs/GraphGenerator.java) written in Java.

```bash
./scripts/test.sh
```

## Implemented algorithms 
The following graph algorithms are implemented.
- [Dijkstra algorithms](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-visual-introduction/).

With Dijkstra's Algorithm, you can find the shortest path between nodes in a graph. Particularly, you can find the shortest path from a node (called the "source node") to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.

This algorithm is used in GPS devices to find the shortest path between the current location and the destination. It has broad applications in industry, specially in domains that require modeling networks.

- [Prim's algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/prims-minimum-spanning-tree-mst-greedy-algo-5/).

Prim's algorithm is an algorithm for constructing the minimum spanning tree of a connected weighted undirected graph. Prim's algorithm finds the subset of edges that includes every vertex of the graph such that the sum of the weights of the edges can be minimized.

First, a random vertex is selected. The edge of the minimum weight incident to the selected vertex is searched for. This is the first edge of the spanning tree.
Next, an edge of the graph of the minimum weight is added to the tree in which only one of the vertices belongs to the tree.
When the number of tree edges is equal to the number of nodes in the graph minus one (the number of nodes in the graph and the tree are equal), the algorithm ends.

- [Kruskal's algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kruskals-minimum-spanning-tree-algorithm-greedy-algo-2/)

Kruskal's Algorithm is used to find the minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph. The main target of the algorithm is to find the subset of edges by using which, we can traverse every vertex of the graph. Kruskal's algorithm follows greedy approach which finds an optimum solution at every stage instead of focusing on a global optimum.

- [Ford Falkeson's algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ford-fulkerson-algorithm-for-maximum-flow-problem/)

The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is an algorithm that tackles the max-flow min-cut problem. That is, given a network with vertices and edges between those vertices that have certain weights, how much "flow" can the network process at a time? Flow can mean anything, but typically it means data through a computer network.

It was discovered in 1956 by Ford and Fulkerson. This algorithm is sometimes referred to as a method because parts of its protocol are not fully specified and can vary from implementation to implementation. An algorithm typically refers to a specific protocol for solving a problem, whereas a method is a more general approach to a problem.
