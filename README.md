[![Latests Results](https://github.com/HSE-Eolang/eo_graphs/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/HSE-Eolang/eo_graphs/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml) 
## What this repository is for?

Is it possible to implement hard enough algorithms with the EO programming language (by the way, if you are not familiar with EO, please visit our main [repo](https://github.com/cqfn/eo))? Would EO manage big enough input data? May EO code be functional, useful yet idiomatic? We tried to address these questions in this work. To do it, we implemented several graph algorithms (Dijkstra, Prim, Kruskal, Ford-Fulkerson) in EO, Java, and C++. We compared their outputs and performance metrics on the same input data. Why did we choose graph algorithms? Well, graph algorithms are hard enough for such a small and young language. And still these algorithms may show how real-life algorithms might look like in EO. Interested in the results? Please, read the instructions below.

## How can I view the results quckly? 
If you would like to view the results only, you may click on the "Latest Results" badge at the top of this README. This badge refers to our latest CI build where you can view the results in the tabs "Compare Results" and "Test Performance".

## How to run it on my machine?
In case if you would like to run the code on your machine, you have two options: using Docker that will do all the work for you, or installing and running the code manually. The second option is not that hard, because we supplied the repository with convenient shell scripts that will do almost all the job. However, unfortunately, you may still need to install some software to build the repository. 

### Downloading sources
Fork this repository with git:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:HSE-Eolang/eo_graphs.git
```
Or, just download it from [here](https://github.com/HSE-Eolang/eo_graphs/archive/refs/heads/master.zip), if you don't have git installed.

### Install and Run via Docker
To run the code via Docker, you need to install Docker to your machine first. Then the following two commands will do all the work for you:
```
cd eo_graphs/
docker build -t "eo-graphs" .
```
Here, we build the Docker Image to run the code on and tag the image with the "eo-graphs" label for convenience.
After the process is finished, run the following command:
```
docker run eo-graphs
```
That's it! Now, you may see the results of comparison of algorithms. 
### Manual Install
#### Tools to be installed

##### Java
First, you need to install Java Development Kit (JDK) on your machine in order to build and work with eo_graphs. Version 11 of JDK would be a good option (you can find 
installation packages [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)). 

##### C++
Second, you need to install GCC on your machine in order to build and work with eo_graphs. Version 11.1 is optimal(you can find 
installation packages [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-11/)).

##### Maven
Third, you need to install Maven on your machine in order to build and work with eo_graphs. Version 3.8.2 is needed(you can find 
installation packages [here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)).

#### Run scripts 
All scripts are running from the root folder of repository (i.e., `eo_graphs/`). So, it will be convenient for you to change the current working directory after cloning the repository:
```
cd eo_graphs
```
All the commands below use relative paths inside this directory.

##### Ð¡ompilation of Java, EO and C ++ source codes

```bash
./scripts/compile.sh
```

##### Comparing the results of executing programs in different languages, to make sure that the result is identical.

```bash
./scripts/compare.sh
```

##### Testing of the execution time and memory consumption of programs on graphs of different sizes. 
Graphs are generated randomly by an [utility](https://github.com/HSE-Eolang/eo_graphs/blob/master/src/main/java/ru/hse/eo_graphs/GraphGenerator.java) written in Java.

```bash
./scripts/test.sh
```

## Implemented algorithms 
The following graph algorithms are implemented.
- [Dijkstra algorithms](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-visual-introduction/).

With Dijkstra's Algorithm, you can find the shortest path between nodes in a graph. Particularly, you can find the shortest path from a node (called the "source node") to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.

This algorithm is used in GPS devices to find the shortest path between the current location and the destination. It has broad applications in industry, specially in domains that require modeling networks.

- [Prim's algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/prims-minimum-spanning-tree-mst-greedy-algo-5/).

Prim's algorithm is an algorithm for constructing the minimum spanning tree of a connected weighted undirected graph. Prim's algorithm finds the subset of edges that includes every vertex of the graph such that the sum of the weights of the edges can be minimized.

First, a random vertex is selected. The edge of the minimum weight incident to the selected vertex is searched for. This is the first edge of the spanning tree.
Next, an edge of the graph of the minimum weight is added to the tree in which only one of the vertices belongs to the tree.
When the number of tree edges is equal to the number of nodes in the graph minus one (the number of nodes in the graph and the tree are equal), the algorithm ends.

- [Kruskal's algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kruskals-minimum-spanning-tree-algorithm-greedy-algo-2/)

Kruskal's Algorithm is used to find the minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph. The main target of the algorithm is to find the subset of edges by using which, we can traverse every vertex of the graph. Kruskal's algorithm follows greedy approach which finds an optimum solution at every stage instead of focusing on a global optimum.


- [Ford Falkeson's algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ford-fulkerson-algorithm-for-maximum-flow-problem/)

The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is an algorithm that tackles the max-flow min-cut problem. That is, given a network with vertices and edges between those vertices that have certain weights, how much "flow" can the network process at a time? Flow can mean anything, but typically it means data through a computer network.

It was discovered in 1956 by Ford and Fulkerson. This algorithm is sometimes referred to as a method because parts of its protocol are not fully specified and can vary from implementation to implementation. An algorithm typically refers to a specific protocol for solving a problem, whereas a method is a more general approach to a problem.
